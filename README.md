<!-- ## Guide

- In order to add a new route (page) you need to add it in `src\lib\NavRoutes.js` and create a new file in the `routes` folder with the same name as the route `eg: about`.

In `src\lib\NavRoutes.js` you need to add in the `routes` an object with the following info for every route you want to add.

    {
    	href: '/globe', // route path
    	label: 'Globe', // name showed in the navbar
    	customColor: '#89a6fb' // OPTIONAL: a color that will be set when you switch route (for that specific route)
    } -->
